# Cloudy With A Chance Of Coding
Week 6 Project - To build a weather app with server side API's

## Languages Used:
I used server side APIs, HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap and custom CSS.
I like to use bootstrap as more as a template and not the full customization of the webpage, I find that there's a lot more options especially when it comes to colours and fonts, but bootstrap defintley takes the guess work out of a responsive design with easy to add things like nav bars, modals, etc. 

## The Vision:
The vision for this project was the colour scheme of a bright sunny day because that's my favorite kind of weather, I wanted it to be a simple colour scheme of mainly blue and white with rounded edges that reminded me of clouds.
