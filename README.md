# Cloudy With A Chance Of Coding
Week 6 Project - To build a weather app with server side API's.

## Languages Used:
I used server side APIs from openWeather, HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, dayJS and custom CSS.
I like to use bootstrap as more as a template and not the full customization of the webpage, I find that there's a lot more options especially when it comes to colours and fonts, but bootstrap defintley takes the guess work out of a responsive design with easy to add things like nav bars, modals, etc. 

## The Vision:
The vision for this project was the colour scheme of blue, white, and black. The colour blue always reminds me of the weather. I wanted to do rounded edges, and put everything in this outline of a box that matches the top with a background that matched the background to keep it nice and simple. For this project I also wanted to come up with a vision board just to see the colours before hand, wrote down the fonts I wanted, the colours in hex, and get an overall vibe of the project before I started to build it.

## Difficulites:
This project was really hard for some parts like getting a invalid API key to work I watch hours of videos about building this and someone said something about postman, and how that checks your API key, because no matter what I did to my url it kept throwing an error at me, and I was told many times that I was writing my code wrong and to do this and that when I knew for a fact it should be returning data in some sort when you console.log() the url that your requesting, turns out it was invalid API key which I learned on postman, couldn't tell you why it was invalid but it was. But overall I think that my JavaScript skills are improving a lot, I'm understanding how the JS language executes and what to put into the code, this was also the first project where I was able to figure out so much on my own and didn't need as much help as previous projects, I did a lot of pseudocoding for this one and I think that it helped.

## What I Learned:
Things that I learned on this project are server side API keys, using the fetch method, I learned to check API keys on postman to save you hours of frustration. 

## Usage:
Type in a city, and it will dynamically appear on the screen, and be saved in your local storage, and show up in the list on the right hand side where you can see what you previously have looked at.
