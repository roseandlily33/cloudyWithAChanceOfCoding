# Cloudy With A Chance Of Coding
Week 6 Project - To build a weather app with server side API's.
That shows the current weather, then the 5 day weather underneath, with a search bar, and a list that displays the weather that you have searched for. 

## Languages Used:
I used server side APIs from openWeather, HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, dayJS and custom CSS.
I like to use bootstrap as more as a template and not the full customization of the webpage, I find that there's a lot more options especially when it comes to colours and fonts, but bootstrap defintley takes the guess work out of a responsive design with easy to add things like nav bars, modals, etc. 

## The Vision:
The vision for this project was the colour scheme of blue, white, and black. The colour blue always reminds me of the weather. I wanted to do rounded edges, and put everything in this outline of a box that matches the top with a background that matched the background to keep it nice and simple. For this project I also wanted to come up with a vision board just to see the colours before hand, wrote down the fonts I wanted, the colours in hex, and get an overall vibe of the project before I started to build it.
There is 2 different versions of icons that I tried out in the link for the icon /w/ gives a blue, bright orange theme, and the /wn/ gives a grey/orange thats more pastel theme. I decided to go with the /wn/ theme because I think that it compliments the colour theme that I chose.

## Deployed Link:
Coming Soon

## Difficulites:
This project was really hard for getting the API to work, I had an invalid API key to work I watch hours of videos about building this and someone said something about postman, and how that checks your API key, because no matter what I did to my url it kept throwing an error at me, and I was told many times that I was writing my code wrong and to do this and that when I knew for a fact it should be returning data in some sort when you console.log() the url that your requesting, turns out it was invalid API key. 
I tried to do a for loop for the 5 day weather on the bottom, but it didn't go so well so I scrapped that idea, and just did each card individually. 

## Successes:
This was the first project since the week 3 that I feel like I really got a good grasp and knew what to do exactly what I was doing and could execute a VERY large portion of it on my own and only really needed help for minor things like I couldn't get something to work because it was spelled wrong and it was one of those things where you just become blind to it. I can tell I'm really turning a corner with JavaScript and truly understanding how it works and what you can do with it, and I am so happy about that!

## What I Learned:
Things that I learned on this project are server side API keys, using the fetch method, I learned to check API keys on postman to save you hours of frustration. I also learned how to select the things that you want from the API information that you get back and how to display that on the screen.

## Usage:
Type in a city, and it will dynamically appear on the screen, and be saved in your local storage, and show up in the list on the right hand side where you can see what you previously have looked at. The weather for the main section is recent, and the bottom shows the weather for the next 5 days at 12pm.
