# Cloudy With A Chance Of Coding
Week 6 Project - To build a weather app with server side API's

## Languages Used:
I used server side APIs, HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap and custom CSS.
I like to use bootstrap as more as a template and not the full customization of the webpage, I find that there's a lot more options especially when it comes to colours and fonts, but bootstrap defintley takes the guess work out of a responsive design with easy to add things like nav bars, modals, etc. 

## The Vision:
The vision for this project was the colour scheme of blue, white, and black. The colour blue always reminds me of the weather. I wanted to do rounded edges, and put everything in this outline of a box that matches the top with a background that matched the background to keep it nice and simple. For this project I also wanted to come up with a vision board just to see the colours before hand, wrote down the fonts I wanted, the colours in hex, and get an overall vibe of the project before I started to build it.
